    "# Using the Broadcast Manager (BCM)\n",
    "The broadcast manager in SocketCAN is helpful in setting up periodic messages. It takes away the timing and loop requirements for the programmer and relegates it to the kernel module. This enables a programmer to focus on the sensing and simulation parts of the program instead of the message timing. \n",
