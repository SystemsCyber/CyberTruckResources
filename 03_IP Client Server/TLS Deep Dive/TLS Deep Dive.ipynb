    "### What is Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n",
    "Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over the internet by encrypting data between two communicating applications. It is commonly used to secure web traffic, email, instant messaging, and other types of communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS operates at the transport layer of the OSI model, which is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications. TLS uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data exchanged between the communicating applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS has become the de facto standard for securing web traffic and is used by most modern web browsers and servers. It is an essential part of online security and is used to protect sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data. TLS is constantly evolving to improve security and address new threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is defined in a series of RFC documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The current version of TLS, TLS 1.3, is defined in RFC 8446, which was published in August 2018. Previous versions of TLS were defined in RFC 5246 (TLS 1.2), RFC 4346 (TLS 1.1), RFC 2246 (TLS 1.0), and RFC 6101 (SSL 3.0)."

    "Breaking a cipher is really hard, so attacks usually focus on recovery of key material to decrypt encrypted traffic.\n",

The attacker then intercepts the ClientKeyExchange message from the client and responds with a fake ClientKeyExchange message pretending to be the client.

    "## Establishing Trust\n",
    "To trust a certificate from a server, the client needs to verify that the certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA) and that the certificate is still valid and has not been revoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client receives a certificate from a server during a TLS handshake, it must perform the following steps to verify the certificate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Validate the digital signature of the certificate to ensure the contents have not been altered. \n",
    "2. Check the certificate's expiration date to ensure that it has not expired.\n",
    "3. Verify that the hostname of the server matches the hostname listed in the certificate.\n",
    "4. Verify that the certificate is issued by a trusted CA. This can be done by checking that the issuer of the certificate is listed in the client's list of trusted root CAs, or by checking the signature chain of the certificate up to a trusted root CA.\n",
    "5. Check if the certificate has been revoked by the issuing CA. This can be done by checking the certificate revocation list (CRL) published by the CA or by using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these steps fail, the client should not trust the certificate and should terminate the TLS handshake.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, most modern browsers do this behind the scenes. Let's look at doing some of these in this notebook."
