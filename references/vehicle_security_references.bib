	abstract = {The On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD-II) port began as a means of extracting diagnostic information and supporting the right to repair. Self-driving vehicles and cellular dongles plugged into the OBD-II port were not anticipated. Researchers have shown that the cellular modem on an OBD-II dongle may be hacked, allowing the attacker to tamper with the vehicle brakes. ADAS, self-driving features and other vehicle functions may be vulnerable as well. The industry must balance the interests of multiple stakeholders including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who are required to provide OBD function, repair shops which have a legitimate need to access the OBD functions, dongle providers and drivers. OEMs need the ability to protect drivers and manage liability by limiting how a device or software application may modify the operation of a vehicle. This paper outlines a technical approach based upon cryptographic authentication and granular access control policy which addresses the needs of stakeholders. This allows the OEM to protect the security of the vehicle by carefully controlling the functions a particular device plugged into the OBD-II port is able to perform. This allows device makers (diagnostic tools, insurance dongles, etc.) to have their products certified to work with the OEMs vehicles. The result is the OEMs can protect driver safety and maintain the right to repair.},

The large amount of information, which is stored in those log les, and the complexity of CPS pose a challenge to experts that try to manually detect anomalies in the systems behavior. We propose to automate anomaly detection in CPS log les by applying a clustering approach to nd time spans, in which the regarded system behaves abnormal. With our approach, we aim to signicantly reduce the time and eort that is needed by experts to discover anomalies in the log les without having to build a model of the system rst. The results from our evaluation show that our generic approach can eectively nd anomalies for dierent types of CPS.},

This paper proposes a exible attacker modeling framework that aids in the security analysis process by simulating a diverse set of attacker behaviors to predict attack progression and provide consistent system vulnerability analysis. The model proposes an expanded architecture of vulnerability databases to maximize its eectiveness and consistency in detecting CPS vulnerabilities while being compatible with existing vulnerability databases. The model has the power to be implemented and simulated against an actual or virtual CPS. Execution of the attacker model is demonstrated against a simulated industrial control system architecture, resulting in a probabilistic prediction of attacker behavior.},

While current attention was largely focused on passenger cars, due to their ubiquity, the reported bus-related vulnerabilities are applicable to all industry sectors where the same bus technology is deployed, i.e., the CAN bus. The SAE J1939 specication extends and standardizes the use of CAN to commercial vehicles where security plays an even higher role. In contrast to empirical results that attest such vulnerabilities in commercial vehicles by practical experiments, here we determine that existing shortcomings in the SAE J1939 specications open road to several new attacks, e.g., impersonation, DoS, DDoS, etc. Taking advantage of an industry-standard CANoe based simulation, we demonstrate attacks with potential safety critical effects that are mounted while still conforming to the SAE J1939 standard specication. We discuss countermeasures and security enhancements by including message authentication mechanisms. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the impact of employing these mechanisms on the overall network communication.},

	abstract = {Controller Area Network (CAN) is the de-facto standard in-vehicle network system. Despite its wide adoption by automobile manufacturers, the lack of security design makes it vulnerable to attacks. For instance, broadcasting packets without authentication allows the impersonation of electronic control units (ECUs). Prior mitigations, such as message authentication or intrusion detection systems, fail to address the compatibility requirement with legacy ECUs, stealthy and sporadic malicious messaging, or guaranteed attack detection. We propose a novel authentication system called ShadowAuth that overcomes the aforementioned challenges by offering backwardcompatible packet authentication to ECUs without requiring ECU firmware source code. Specifically, our authentication scheme provides transparent CAN packet authentication without modifying existing CAN packet definitions (e.g., J1939) via automatic ECU firmware instrumentation technique to locate CAN packet transmission code, and instrument authentication code based on the CAN packet behavioral transmission patterns. ShadowAuth enables vehicles to detect state-of-the-art CAN attacks, such as busoff and packet injection, responsively within 60ms without false positives. ShadowAuth provides a sound and deployable solution for real-world ECUs.},

While this transformation has driven major advancements in efciency and safety, it has also introduced a range of new potential risks.

We demonstrate that an attacker who is able to inltrate virtually any Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can leverage this ability to completely circumvent a broad array of safety-critical systems. Over a range of experiments, both in the lab and in road tests, we demonstrate the ability to adversarially control a wide range of automotive functions and completely ignore driver input including disabling the brakes, selectively braking individual wheels on demand, stopping the engine, and so on. We nd that it is possible to bypass rudimentary network security protections within the car, such as maliciously bridging between our cars two internal subnets. We also present composite attacks that leverage individual weaknesses, including an attack that embeds malicious code in a cars telematics unit and that will completely erase any evidence of its presence after a crash. Looking forward, we discuss the complex challenges in addressing these vulnerabilities while considering the existing automotive ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Modern vehicles utilize various functionalities that require security solutions such as secure in-vehicle communication and ECU authentication. Cryptographic keys are the basis for such security solutions. We propose two approaches for secure and efficient invehicle key management. In both approaches, an ECU acting as a Key Master in the vehicle is required. The first approach is based on SHE. The Key Master generates and distributes new keys to all ECU based on the SHE key update protocol. The second approach performs key establishment based on key derivation. The Key Master sends a trigger in form of a counter and all ECUs derive new keys based on the received counter value and pre-shared keys. It is thus possible to handle in-vehicle key management without the need for an OEM backend to manage all keys. This reduces cost and complexity of the solution. It avoids using the same keys in a vehicle for long periods of time since keys can be updated regularly within the vehicle without any external interaction. We have implemented the approaches on a test bench and performed an evaluation. Approach 1 is more secure and takes roughly 32 ms per key to load into SHE. Approach 2 is more efficient and takes roughly 5 ms to generate all new keys on the ECUs.},

As a result, the extra measures have to be taken to address the key security properties of the secure CAN communication, including data integrity, authenticity, confidentiality and freshness. While integrity and authenticity can be achieved by using a relatively straightforward algorithms such as CMAC (Cipher-based Message Authentication Code) and Confidentiality can be handled by a symmetric encryption algorithm like AES128 (128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard), it has been recognized to be more challenging to achieve the freshness of CAN message.

	abstract = {The lack of inherent security controls makes traditional Controller Area Network (CAN) buses vulnerable to Machine-In-The-Middle (MitM) cybersecurity attacks. Conventional vehicular MitM attacks involve tampering with the hardware to directly manipulate CAN bus traffic. We show, however, that MitM attacks can be realized without direct tampering of any CAN hardware. Our demonstration leverages how diagnostic applications based on RP1210 are vulnerable to Machine-In-The-Middle attacks. Test results show SAE J1939 communications, including single frame and multi-framed broadcast and on-request messages, are susceptible to data manipulation attacks where a shim DLL is used as a Machine-In-The-Middle. The demonstration shows these attacks can manipulate data that may mislead vehicle operators into taking the wrong actions. A solution is proposed to mitigate these attacks by utilizing machine authentication codes or authenticated encryption with pre-shared keys between the communicating parties. Various tradeoffs, such as communication overhead encryption time and J1939 protocol compliance, are presented while implementing the mitigation strategy. One of our key findings is that the data flowing through RP1210-based diagnostic systems are vulnerable to MitM attacks launched from the host diagnostics computer. Security models should include controls to detect and mitigate these data flows. An example of a cryptographic security control to mitigate the risk of an MitM attack was implemented and demonstrated by using the SAE J1939 DM18 message. This approach, however, utilizes over twice the bandwidth as normal communications. Sensitive data should utilize such a security control.},

	abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol has become the primary choice for in-vehicle communications for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. However, it is possible for malicious adversaries to cause major damage by exploiting flaws in the CAN protocol design or implementation. Researchers have shown that an attacker can remotely inject malicious messages into the CAN network in order to disrupt or alter normal vehicle behavior. Some of these attacks can lead to catastrophic consequences for both the vehicle and the driver. Although there are several defense techniques against CAN based attacks, attack surfaces like physically and remotely controllable Electronic Control Units (ECUs) can be used to launch attacks on protocols running on top of the CAN network, such as the SAE J1939 protocol. Commercial vehicles adhere to the SAE J1939 standards that make use of the CAN protocol for physical communication and that are modeled in a manner similar to that of the ISO/OSI 7 layer protocol stack. We posit that the J1939 standards can be subjected to attacks similar to those that have been launched successfully on the OSI layer protocols. Towards this end, we demonstrate how such attacks can be performed on a test-bed having 3 J1939 speaking ECUs connected via a single high-speed CAN bus. Our main goal is to show that the regular operations performed by the J1939 speaking ECUs can be disrupted by manipulating the packet exchange protocols and specifications made by J1939 data-link layer standards. The list of attacks documented in this paper is not comprehensive but given the homogeneous and ubiquitous usage of J1939 standards in commercial vehicles we believe these attacks, along with newer attacks introduced in the future, can cause widespread damage in the heavy vehicle industry, if not mitigated pro-actively.},

The processes involved contain complex interactions, meaning that the support of software tools is benecial; while not aiming to provide a review of the state-of-the-art of TARA tooling, this article provides observations based on the real-world use of two software tools that support the development of TARAs.},

This current paper includes examination of a) the maximum acceptable latency based on the vehicular requirements as well as b) the latency in communication when employing various encryption algorithms. In Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulations, our work suggests that in-vehicular networks can absorb the latencies introduced by select encryption approaches and still satisfy the real-time requirements needed by the intra-vehicular communication system to avoid collisions and the like.},

	abstract = {Software update systems for automobiles can deliver signicant benets, but, if not implemented carefully, they could potentially incur serious security vulnerabilities. Previous solutions for securing software updates consider standard attacks and deploy widely understood security mechanisms, such as digital signatures for the software updates, and hardware security modules (HSM) to sign software updates. However, no existing solution considers more advanced security objectives, such as resilience against a repository compromise, or freeze attacks to the vehicles update mechanism, or a compromise at a suppliers site. Solutions developed for the PC world do not generalize to automobiles for two reasons: rst, they do not solve problems that are unique to the automotive industry (e.g., that there are many different types of computers to be updated on a vehicle), and second, they do not address security attacks that can cause a vehicle to fail (e.g. a man-in-themiddle attack without compromising any signing key) or that can cause a vehicle to become unsafe. In this paper, we present Uptane, the rst software update framework for automobiles that counters a comprehensive array of security attacks, and is resilient to partial compromises. Uptane adds strategic features to the state-of-the-art software update framework, TUF, in order to address automotivespecic vulnerabilities and limitations. Uptane is exible and easy to adopt, and its design details were developed together with the main automotive industry stakeholders in the USA.},

While this transformation has driven significant advancements in efficiency and safety, it has also opened a door to a wide variety of cyberattacks, as the architectures of vehicles were never designed with external connectivity in mind, and accordingly, security has never been pivotal in the design. As standardized, the OBD-II port allows not only direct access to the internal network of the vehicle but also installing software on the Electronic Control Units (ECUs). While this privilege, historically, is achieved through physical access on the underlying port using a dedicated tool, remote access is recently supported in many modern vehicles, i.e., self-driving ones, and via OBD-II dongles, making the OBD-II port the most significant automotive interface that has to be secured.},

However, HDVs are more susceptible to malicious attacks due to lack of security in their intra-vehicle communication protocols. SAE proposed a new standard named J1939-91C for CAN-FD networks which provides methods for establishing trust and securing mutual messages with optional encryption. J1939-91C ensures message authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality by implementing complex cryptographic operations including hash functions and random key generation. In this paper, the three main phases of J1939-91C, i.e., Network Formation, Rekeying, and Message Exchange, are simulated and tested on Electronic Control Units (ECUs) supporting CAN-FD network. Numerous test vectors were generated and validated to support SAE J1939-91C. The mentioned vectors were produced by simulating different encryption and hashing algorithms with variable message and key lengths. Moreover, the output vectors of each phase were passed to the subsequent phase to build up a complete scenario. The obtained simulation results will be used in the future for assessing the benefits of the standard as well as identifying potential strengths or possible shortcomings of the new protocol and to help suggest recommended enhancements and modifications.{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {With the growing trend of the Internet of Things, a large number of wireless OBD-II dongles are developed, which can be simply plugged into vehicles to enable remote functions such as sophisticated vehicle control and status monitoring. However, since these dongles are directly connected with in-vehicle networks, they may open a new over-the-air attack surface for vehicles. In this paper, we conduct the rst comprehensive security analysis on all wireless OBD-II dongles available on Amazon in the US in February 2019, which were 77 in total. To systematically perform the analysis, we design and implement an automated tool DONGLESCOPE that dynamically tests these dongles from all possible attack stages on a real automobile. With DONGLESCOPE, we have identied 5 different types of vulnerabilities, with 4 being newly discovered. Our results reveal that each of the 77 dongles exposes at least two types of these vulnerabilities, which indicates a widespread vulnerability exposure among wireless OBD-II dongles on the market today. To demonstrate the severity, we further construct 4 classes of concrete attacks with a variety of practical implications such as privacy leakage, property theft, and even safety threat. We also discuss the root causes and feasible countermeasures, and have made corresponding responsible disclosure.},

	abstract = {As automotive security concerns are rising, the Controller Area Network (CAN)  the de facto standard of in-vehicle communication protocol  has come under scrutiny due to its lack of encryption and authentication. Several vulnerabilities, such as eavesdropping, spoofing, and replay attacks, have shown that the current implementation needs to be extended. Both academic and commercial solutions for a Secure CAN (S-CAN) have been proposed, but OEMs have not yet integrated them into their products. The main reasons for this lack of adoption are their heavy use of limited computational resources in the vehicle, increased latency that can lead to missed deadlines for safety-critical messages, as well as insufficient space available in a CAN frame to include a Message Authentication Code (MAC).},

	abstract = {Controller Area Network (CAN) is an in-vehicle communication protocol, which provides an efficient and reliable communication link between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in real time. Recent studies have shown that attackers can take remote control of the targeted vehicle by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the CAN protocol. Motivated by this fact, we propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), called Clock Offsetbased IDS (COIDS), to monitor in-vehicle network activities to detect any intrusion. Precisely, COIDS measures and then exploits the clock offset of transmitter ECUs clock for fingerprinting ECU. COIDS next leverages the derived fingerprints to construct a baseline of ECUs normal clock behavior using an active learning technique. Based on the baseline of normal behavior, COIDS uses the Cumulative Sum method to detect any abnormal deviation in clock offset. Further, COIDS uses a sequential change-point detection technique to determine the exact time of intrusion. Generally, COIDS has to run on every ECU to monitor the network behavior. This can turn out to be a significant power overhead for a hardware-constrained ECU. Thus, we next develop a cooperative game model to optimize the active time duration of COIDS in an ECU. We performed exhaustive experiments on real world publicly available datasets primarily to assess the effectiveness of COIDS against a wide range of in-vehicle network attacks. Our results show that COIDS detects intrusions faster than the best performed IDS in the state-ofthe-art. Further, the results show that our designed cooperative game model significantly reduces the power overhead of the ECU without compromising the performance.},

This contribution presents an end-to-end approach to the definition, generation, and application of software patches in the automotive environment. First, a new vulnerability identifier defines a particular instance of the vulnerability, including the affected file and the problematic code segment within the file. Secondly, this identifier is sent to the vehicles as part of the configuration file, and the onboard patch engine generates the actual patch. Thirdly, this patch is applied to fix this vulnerability, either statically, in the file, or dynamically, within the RAM during software execution.},

We build on the EBRM architecture and construct a Blockchain-Based Root Management (BBRM) to provide even greater decentralization and security. More specifically, BBRM uses blockchain to i) replace the existing RCA and have the electors directly involved in the root certificate generation, ii) control the elector network membership including elector addition and revocation, and iii) provide greater accountability and transparency on the aforementioned functionalities. We implement BBRM on Hyperledger Fabric using smart contract for system experimentation and analyses. Our experiments show that BBRM is lightweight in processing, efficient in ledger size, and supports a bandwidth of multiple transactions per second. Our results show that the BBRM blockchain is appropriate for the root certificate generation and the elector membership control for EBRM within SCMS, which are significantly smaller in number and occurrences than the SCMS outputs of vehicle certificates. We also experiment to analyze how the BBRM distributed consensus protocol parameters, such as the number of electors and the number of required votes, affect the overall schemes performances.},

We demonstrate that the weakness can be exploited by the adversary on a real ECU to breach the protection of Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) Security Access service and access restricted functionality of the UDS protocol. We develop CANdid, a stepping-stone attack strategy where an adversary with access to a non-critical ECU can utilize this weakness to maliciously reprogram an arbitrary critical ECU over the CAN bus.},

The objectives are to provide access to the vehicle network from user-installed applications in the infotainment environment, in a secure and controlled way. As the infotainment domain is no longer confined to a single node, an in-vehicle IP (Internet Protocol) based subnet is used. The concept is based on standard technologies and is using a layered architecture, where the networking layer is the lowest level. The messaging layer consists of publish-subscribe messaging using the MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) protocol running via the Secure Gateway Core, consisting of a broker with custom add-ons. Communication is encrypted via TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates, and the broker handles access control to different MQTT message topics. The service layer consists of resources and applications, which are software abstraction of devices, and users of these resources, respectively. Presence information is handled for resources, which also enables plug-andplay installation of aftermarket additions. In the vehicle network adaptor the IP-network and the safety-critical network meet. There are no open (inbound) IP ports on the vehicle network adaptor.},

Secure Credential Management System (SCMS) is a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) which provides certicates to vehicles to preserve vehicular privacy and supports many vehicular applications such as Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), misbehavior reporting, etc. On the other hand, privacy-preserving applications like federated learning (used to enable data-driven machine learning for better self-driving experience while protecting the vehicular data privacy) are outside of this SCMS-managed vehicular network and have separate PKI structure managed by a different authority. Since the trust management and PKI for vehicular vs. federated learning have been studied and developed separately, there is a need to establish trust between these two PKIs for secure communication between vehicles and Federated Learning Servers (FLSs). In this work, we demonstrate and analyze how these two orthogonal PKIs can establish trust with each other and thus, the end entities (vehicles and FLSs) can securely communicate with each other in an efcient manner to maintain vehicular privacy utilizing SCMS.},

	abstract = {In this article we propose a standard for role-based access control (RBAC). Although RBAC models have received broad support as a generalized approach to access control, and are well recognized for their many advantages in performing large-scale authorization management, no single authoritative definition of RBAC exists today. This lack of a widely accepted model results in uncertainty and confusion about RBAC's utility and meaning. The standard proposed here seeks to resolve this situation by unifying ideas from a base of frequently referenced RBAC models, commercial products, and research prototypes. It is intended to serve as a foundation for product development, evaluation, and procurement specification. Although RBAC continues to evolve as users, researchers, and vendors gain experience with its application, we feel the features and components proposed in this standard represent a fundamental and stable set of mechanisms that may be enhanced by developers in further meeting the needs of their customers. As such, this document does not attempt to standardize RBAC features beyond those that have achieved acceptance in the commercial marketplace and research community, but instead focuses on defining a fundamental and stable set of RBAC components. This standard is organized into the RBAC Reference Model and the RBAC System and Administrative Functional Specification. The reference model defines the scope of features that comprise the standard and provides a consistent vocabulary in support of the specification. The RBAC System and Administrative Functional Specification defines functional requirements for administrative operations and queries for the creation, maintenance, and review of RBAC sets and relations, as well as for specifying system level functionality in support of session attribute management and an access control decision process.},

	abstract = {This work introduces the concept of a dual-layer specification structure for standards that separates interoperability functions, such as backward compatibility, localization, and deployment, from those essential to reliability, security, and functionality. The latter group of features, which constitute the actual standard, make up the baseline layer for instructions, while all the elements required for interoperability are specified in a second layer, known as a Protocols, Operations, Usage, and Formats (POUF) document. We applied this technique in the development of a standard for Uptane [1], a security framework for over-the-air (OTA) software updates used in many automobiles. This standard is a good candidate for a dual-layer specification because it requires communication between entities, but does not require a specific format for this communication. By deferring wire protocols and other implementation details to POUFs, the creators of the Uptane Standard were able to focus on the basic procedures and operations needed to secure automotive updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this format by specifying a POUF for the Uptane Reference Implementation [2].},

Validation and verification testing is a key activity for measuring the effectiveness of risk management, and it is mandated by UN R155 for type approval. Due to the focus of R155 and its suggested implementation guideline, ISO/SAE 21434:2021Road Vehicle Cybersecurity Engineering, mainly centering on the alignment of cybersecurity risk management to the vehicle development lifecycle, there is a gap in knowledge of proscribed activities for validation and verification testing. This research provides guidance on automotive cybersecurity testing and verification by providing an overview of the state-of-the-art in relevant automotive standards, outlining their transposition into national regulation and the currently used processes and tools in the automotive industry. Through engagement with state-of-the-art literature and workshops and surveys with industry groups, our study found that national regulatory authorities are moving to enshrine UN R155 as part of their vehicle regulations, with differences of implementation based on regulatory culture and pre-existing approaches to vehicle regulation. Validation and verification testing is developing aligned to UN R155 and ISO21434:2021; however, the testing approaches currently used within industry utilize elements of traditional enterprise information technology methods for penetration testing and toolsets.

The first priority of subcommittee 16 was to develop an architecture for open systems interconnection which could serve as a framework for the definition of standard protocols. As a result of 18 months of studies and discussions, SC16 adopted a layered architecture comprising seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application). In July 1979 the specifications of this architecture, established by SC16, were passed under the name of "OSI Reference Model" to Technical Committee 97 "Data Processing" along with recommendations to start officially, on this basis, a set of protocols standardization projects to cover the most urgent needs. These recommendations were adopted by T.C97 at the end of 1979 as the basis for the following development of standards for Open Systems Interconnectlon within ISO. The OSI Reference Model was also recognized by CCITT Rapporteur's Group on "Layered Model for Public Data Network Services." This paper presents the model of architecture for Open Systems Interconnection developed by SC16. Some indications are also given on the initial set of protocols which will-likely be developed in this OSI Reference Model.},

	abstract = {Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is intended to improve how systems engineering is performed compared with a more traditional document-based approach by effectively using models to analyze, specify, design, and verify systems. The OMG Systems Modeling Language (OMG SysML) enables the practice of MBSE by providing a robust and expressive language for representing systems. Several MBSE methods are available [3], and have continued to mature over the last several years which include model-based practices for requirements flow-down, architecture-design, trade-off analysis, verification planning, and others. One of the critical systems engineering practices is interface modeling. This paper describes a layered interface pattern for modeling data and communications interfaces using SysML. The pattern spans logical to physical interface definition, and includes software and electrical interfaces. Each layer in a stack describes a portion of the interface functionality. The concept of a layered interface is borrowed from computer networking [8] [10]. The layered interface pattern described in this paper enables the specification and design of connections and behavior between interfacing systems at a given layer, and between the adjacent layers of a single system. This pattern may also be applied recursively. That is, communication within a single layer may itself be realized by a multi-layer stack. The level of detail of the model to describe a layered interface should be adapted to the need, and can vary from highly abstract logical flows across a system to highly detailed protocol specifications and message structures. This paper builds on work that was documented in a previous paper entitled A modeling pattern for layered system interfaces [5]. Aspects of this pattern have been demonstrated in various project applications including Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1), Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) Trade Studies, and the SCaN Network Integration Project (SNIP).},

However, while previous research has shown that the internal networks within some modern cars are insecure, the associated threat model--requiring prior physical access--has justifiably been viewed as unrealistic. Thus, it remains an open question if automobiles can also be susceptible to remote compromise. Our work seeks to put this question to rest by systematically analyzing the external attack surface of a modern automobile. We discover that remote exploitation is feasible via a broad range of attack vectors (including mechanics tools, CD players, Bluetooth and cellular radio), and further, that wireless communications channels allow long distance vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin audio exfiltration and theft. Finally, we discuss the structural characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that give rise to such problems and highlight the practical challenges in mitigating them.},

	abstract = {The Engineering community is adopting a Digital Engineering approach enabled by Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) as an effective tool for designing complex systems. As technology continues to rapidly advance, security risk mitigation and requirements engineering is becoming a prominent and important factor in the cybersecurity domain. MBSEsec is a security-focused MBSE method using SysML to develop a system architecture that highlights security design considerations. The modeling process used in the MBSEsec method facilitates security requirements and controls elicitation through a structured workflow of specific systems modeling activities. This work illustrates the application of MBSEsec to securing vehicle network transport protocols. The discovery and validation of new exploits that take advantage of vulnerabilities in the data-link layer of the protocol highlights the need to elicit better security requirements for cyber physical systems (CPS). This paper addresses the three pillars of MBSE to secure network architecture, and models five transport protocol vulnerabilities that have been validated and exploited. Using MBSEsec we create security requirements, identify system assets, model threats and risks, and generate security controls for network transport protocols. This work uses heavy vehicle network transport protocol, J1939, as the System of Interest. Using the J1939 network as the SOI for this work allows the models to be supported by and validated with on-vehicle testing. This work contributes a survey of modeling approaches for secure system design, a detailed application of MBSEsec to a CPS network, and illustrates a recommended addition of a new element attacker to the MBSEsec profile. This addition, as well as a detailed threat analysis through attack modeling, enables the generation of more accurate, complete, and effective security requirements for preexisting systems.},

In this paper, we unveil a new important vulnerability applicable to several in-vehicle networks including Control Area Network (CAN), the de facto standard in-vehicle network protocol. Specically, we propose a new type of Denial-of-Service (DoS), called the busoff attack, which exploits the error-handling scheme of in-vehicle networks to disconnect or shut down good/uncompromised ECUs. This is an important attack that must be thwarted, since the attack, once an ECU is compromised, is easy to be mounted on safetycritical ECUs while its prevention is very difcult. In addition to the discovery of this new vulnerability, we analyze its feasibility using actual in-vehicle network trafc, and demonstrate the attack on a CAN bus prototype as well as on two real vehicles. Based on our analysis and experimental results, we also propose and evaluate a mechanism to detect and prevent the bus-off attack.},

	abstract = {With the advent of modern vehicular technology, the computerized components of passenger vehicles have become increasingly interconnected to facilitate automotive efficiency, driving experience, and emissions control. Controller Area Networks (CANs) are well suited for intercommunications among these components, called electronic control units (ECUs). ECUs are used to communicate with critical control systems on automobiles including transmissions, braking, body control, and even vehicle infotainment systems. CAN networks are designed for high speed, reliable communications between ECU components operating in harsh environments. Unfortunately, the security of the underlying protocol is dubious at best. The Bosch CAN standard does not include inherent security mechanisms for authentication and validation of messages sent to various ECUs over a CAN network. Currently the only data security methods for CAN networks on passenger vehicles are the use of proprietary CAN message IDs and a physical boundary between the CAN bus and the outside world. This presents a serious security issue, because anyone with physical access to the vehicle's data bus could generate spoofed CAN traffic destined for various ECUs, some of which could be responsible for critical vehicle operations such as the braking system or engine control unit. To prevent this, manufactures of passenger vehicles do not publish the proprietary CAN message IDs for various components on the vehicle network. However, proprietary message IDs can be identified through a reverse engineering process. This paper identifies techniques for reverse engineering CAN messages on passenger vehicles, demonstrating the ease with which an attacker could manipulate CAN-enabled components of an automobile. The reverse engineering methodology is demonstrated by the transformation of the speedometer and tachometer (instrument cluster) of a 2003 Mini Cooper into a functional clock controlled via spoofed CAN messages sent by an Arduino microcontroller.},

To analyse the current situation and the potentially growing tendency of arising threats we performed several practical tests on recent automotive technology. With a focus on automotive systems based on CAN bus technology, this article summarises the results of four selected tests performed on the control systems for the window lift, warning light and airbag control system as well as the central gateway. These results are supplemented in this article by a classication of these four attack scenarios using the established CERT taxonomy and an analysis of underlying security vulnerabilities, and especially, potential safety implications.},

Researchers, hobbyists, and hackers have compromised security keys used by vehicles' electronic control units (ECUs), modified ECU software, and hacked wireless transmissions from vehicle key fobs and tire monitoring sensors. Malware can infect vehicles through Internet connectivity, onboard diagnostic interfaces, devices tethered wirelessly or physically to the vehicle, malware-infected aftermarket devices or spare parts, and onboard Wi-Fi hotspot. Once vehicles are interconnected, compromised vehicles can also be used to attack the connected transportation system and other vehicles. Securing connected vehicles impose a range of unique new challenges. This paper describes some of these unique challenges and presents an end-to-end cloud-assisted connected vehicle security framework that can address these challenges.{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},
